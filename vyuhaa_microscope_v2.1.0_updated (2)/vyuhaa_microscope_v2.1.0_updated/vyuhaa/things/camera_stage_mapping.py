"""Vyuhaa Microscope API extension for stage calibration.

This file contains the HTTP API for camera/stage calibration. It
includes calibration functions that measure the relationship between
stage coordinates and camera coordinates, as well as functions that
move by a specified displacement in pixels, perform closed-loop moves,
and return the calibration data.

This module is only intended to be called from the Vyuhaa Microscope
server, and depends on that server and its underlying LabThings library.
